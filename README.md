# CPU Monitor App
This is a Desktop Application which helps monitor CPU usuage, Total Memory Usuage and Free Memory. The parameter values get updated every 1 second. This is developed using HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Electron Framework
This project requires NodeJS and I have used Gitbash interface and Visual Studio Code for programming.
NPM command to install Electron: npm install electron -g

**This project can be created from scratch but I have used Electron forge tool which helps to setup a project very quicky with some skeleton code to start from

NPM command : npm install create-electron-app -g

To create a new project: create-electron-app project_name

To run the project: npm run start

Once the App is ready we need to package it and create an installer. Below is the npm command which will help to package our app as an executable .exe file on the local system

npm run make
