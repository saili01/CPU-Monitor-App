# CPU Monitor App
This is a Desktop Application which helps monitor CPU usuage, Total Memory Usuage and Free Memory. The parameter values get updated every 1 second. This is developed using HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Electron Framework
This project requires NodeJS and I have used Gitbash interface and Visual Studio Code for programming.
NPM command to install Electron: npm install electron -g

**This project can be created from scratch but I have used Electron forge tool which helps to setup a project very quicky with some skeleton code to start from
NPM command : npm install create-electron-app -g
To create a new project: create-electron-app project_name
To run the project: npm run start
